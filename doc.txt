This is a set of scripts that can be used to send files through a
unidirectional gateway.

It has four scripts:

- The 'spooler' and 'processor' run on the one side of the gateway.
- The 'receiver' and 'recoverer' run on the other side of the gateway.

The workflow:

- Copy the file to the spool directory.
- The 'spooler' will absorb (and remove when done) the files and convert
  them to chunks that can individually be error recovered.
- The 'processor' will absorb (and remove when done) the chunk files and
  send them out as UDP fragments to the other side.

On the other side:

- The 'receiver' will receive UDP packets from the network and store them
  as files.  It has limits as to how it long it will wait for all the
  fragments to arrive, before it eventually writes them out as one big file.
- The 'recoverer' will recover the files from the previous process
  and offer them to the user on the other side.

Parametrization:

- Size of chunks.
- Size of UDP payloads.
- Time to wait for fragments.
